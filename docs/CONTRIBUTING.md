## Thank You 😄

Thank you for taking the time to contribute and help TableX to grow and evolve!.

All contributions are very welcomed, starting from fixing typos or reporting issues to bug fixes and pushing cool features.

Whatever the level of your expertise, you will definitely find some issue that suites you best. ( Check out the [issues](https://github.com/kareemmahlees/tablex/issues) section ).

## Some Guidelines to follow

Make sure you have fulfilled the requirements and local development steps mentioned [here](../README.md#local-development-🧑🏻‍💻).

## Commits

TableX follows commit conventions inforced by [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint).

Commit checking is highly integrated in all parts of development process either as a pre-commit hook or checking by the lint action on push or pull-request.

This is a very crucial part and we care about it soo much to keep the commit log consistent and clean, so please take the time to read the conventions of commitlint.

## Multiply tiny is better than a Big one

Separating your changes into multiple small commits is better to review and debug than a big fat commit

## Changesets

It is very preferable to add a changeset at the end of your work in the pr.
Please refer to [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) documentation for more info.
