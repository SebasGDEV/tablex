## Local Development üßëüèª‚Äçüíª

To start playing around with TableX locally, you will need the following requirements:

- Node v20.9.0 or later ( you can use the .nvmrc )
- Cargo 1.74.1 or later
- pnpm 8.13.1 or later

> some previous versions of the previously mentioned requirements may still work fine, but no guarantee.

Once you have setup the previous requirements, you can start by cloning the repo:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/kareemmahlees/tablex.git --depth=1
```

> Note: TableX uses MetaX as a **submodule**, so, once you have ran the above command you will se an empty meta-x folder.
> there is no need to delete that.

then, install necessary dependencies:

```shell
pnpm install
# And
cargo install
```

install husky git hooks:

```bash
pnpm husky install
```

and you are good to go üí´, you can start your development server by running:

```bash
pnpm tauri:dev
```

Want to test how your modification will look like at the final executable? run this:

```shell
pnpm tauri:debug
```

this will create a debug build/executables of the application that you can then install and see your features in action ü•≥

> Note: the `tauri:build` script requires `Golang` to be installed in order to build _MetaX_ and include it as a sidecar in the release build.
